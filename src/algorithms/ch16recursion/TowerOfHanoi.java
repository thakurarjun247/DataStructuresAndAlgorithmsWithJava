Time Complexity :
        Let the time required for n disks is T(n) .
        There are 2 recursive call for n-1 disks and one constant time operation to move a disk
        from ‘from’ peg to ‘to’ peg . Let it be k1.
        Therefore,
        T(n) = 2 T(n-1) + k1
        T(0) = k2 , a constant.
        T(1) = 2 k2 + k1
        T(2) = 4 k2 + 2k1 + k1
        T(2) = 8 k2 + 4k1 + 2k1 + k1
        Coefficient of k1 =2n
        Coefficient of k2 =2n
        -1
        Time complexity is O(2n
        ) or O(an
        ) where a is a constant greater than 1.
        So it has exponential time complexity. For single increase in problem size the time
        required is double the previous one. This is computationally very expensive. Most of the
        recursive programs takes exponential time that is why it is very hard to write them
        iteratively .
        Space Complexity:
        Space for parameter for each call is independent of n i.e., constant. Let it be k .
        When we do the 2nd recursive call 1st recursive call is over . So, we can reuse the space of
        1st call for 2nd call . Hence ,
        T(n) = T(n-1) + k
        T(0) = k
        T(1) = 2k
        T(2) = 3k
        T(3) = 4k
        So the space complexity is O(n).
        Here time complexity is exponential but space complexity is linear . Often there is a trade
        off between time and space complexity .*/
